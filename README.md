# Movie DB
## What is this
This is a simple backend for two other repositories, workshop-angular-frontend and workshop-react-frontend.
The backend implements a simple movie database that during run-time resides in an embedded 
database. The clients can make simple queries for movies.

## Requirements
You will need docker, java and `make`command available on your computer to install the
docker image and to run it. Please use internet and relevant communities to get help how
to get these applications installed unless you don't have it.

## Installing
Download the repo and run `make release` to install code and build
a docker image with application. The docker images can be run using
`make docker-run`. Use `make help` to get all available commands
